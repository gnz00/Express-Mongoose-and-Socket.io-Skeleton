# Express-Mongoose-and-Socket.io-Skeleton
Disclaimer: This is a work in progress. I've compiled this repo from several other skeletons and begun to upgrade each file to ES6. Currently only the Google OAuth has been implemented. I haven't been satisfied with PassportJS which everyone else seems to use. 

Goals:

ES6 w/ Webpack    
Node 5, Express 4
